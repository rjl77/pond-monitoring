# Pond Monitoring Project

Scripts (mostly Python, so far) to monitor various aspects of a backyard koi pond - environmental conditions, including temperature, water level, and potential threats (e.g., predators). Nothing terribly fancy or intelligent, just some messing around with a mixture of Raspberry Pi, sensor devices, Hubitat, IP cameras and computer vision.

## Project Overview

The project consists of several components:

- **Temperature Monitoring:**  
  The `temperature/` subfolder contains two scripts:
  - **Hubitat Temperature Monitor:**  
    Polls a water temperature sensor, calculates current, high, and low temperatures over a rolling 24-hour window, and sends the data to a Hubitat home automation hub via API calls.
  - **Cacti Temperature Charting Script:**  
    Reads air and water temperatures from 1-Wire sensors and prints the values (formatted for charting via Cacti or a similar platform).

- **Computer Vision:**  
  (Coming soon) Scripts that use computer vision to identity & alert for potential predators (focussing on Herons for now): training models/weights, analyzing video feeds, testing tools, etc.  

- **Water Level Monitoring:**  
  (Planned) Future scripts to monitor the water level in the pond.
